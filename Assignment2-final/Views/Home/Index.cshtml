        <h2>CT</h2>
        <p>
            CT (Computed Tomography) is a medical imaging technique that uses X-rays and computers to create detailed cross-sectional images of the inside of the body. CT scans provide more detailed information than regular X-rays and are used to diagnose and monitor conditions such as cancer, heart disease, infections, trauma injuries, and more. CT technology allows doctors to view internal organs, blood vessels, bones and tissues in different "slices" of the body. CT scans are painless, noninvasive procedures that play an important role in healthcare.

        <h2>MRI</h2>
        <p>
            MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a medical imaging technique that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of the body. It does not use radiation like X-rays or CT scans. MRI creates cross-sectional images of organs and tissues by aligning hydrogen atoms in the body with the magnets. It provides excellent contrast between different soft tissues in the body. MRI is used to diagnose and monitor neurological conditions, cancers, cardiovascular disease, joint problems, and more. It provides detailed images of organs, soft tissues, bone and virtually all other internal body structures. MRI scans are noninvasive and do not cause pain.

        <h2>Ultrasound</h2>
        <p>
            Ultrasound is a widely used medical imaging technique that utilizes high-frequency sound waves to produce images of internal body structures. A transducer probe emits inaudible sound waves that bounce off tissues and organs, and the echoes are converted into images. Ultrasound is used to examine many areas of the body including the abdomen, heart, blood vessels, muscles, joints, tendons, eyes and more. It provides real-time imaging, is portable, non-invasive and does not use ionizing radiation. Ultrasound is routinely used in obstetrics to view a developing fetus. It also helps guide minimally invasive procedures like biopsies. Ultrasound is an accessible, versatile and safe imaging modality used for both diagnosis and treatment monitoring.

        <h2>PET</h2>
        <p>
            PET (Positron Emission Tomography) is a nuclear imaging technique that produces 3D images of functional processes in the body. It works by detecting gamma rays emitted by a radioactive tracer injected into the body. The tracer accumulates in tissues with high metabolic activity, such as cancer cells. PET scans are used to diagnose various conditions like cancer, heart disease and brain disorders. They can identify early biochemical changes before anatomical changes are visible. PET provides unique information about both the structure and function of organs and tissues. It is combined with CT or MRI to produce more detailed images. PET enables accurate disease detection and staging, treatment response monitoring, and surgical or radiotherapy planning. It is an important molecular imaging technology.

        <h2>X-Ray</h2>
        <p>
            X-ray is a common medical imaging technique that uses ionizing radiation to view structures inside the body. X-rays pass through soft tissues and are absorbed at different rates by dense tissues like bone, allowing a skeletal image to be captured on film or digitally. Chest x-rays can detect pneumonia, lung cancer, heart failure, rib fractures and more. Abdominal x-rays examine the intestines, kidneys and stomach. X-rays are used to diagnose bone breaks and are also used in mammography and angiography procedures. While x-rays have risks from radiation exposure, their fast acquisition times, low costs and high availability make them one of the most frequently used diagnostic imaging tests. When used judiciously, x-rays are an indispensable medical imaging tool.

        <h2>DXA</h2>
        <p>
            DXA (Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry) is an imaging technology that uses low dose x-rays to measure bone mineral density. It is the most widely used method for diagnosing osteoporosis and assessing fracture risk. DXA scans precisely determine bone loss by measuring the absorption of photons by bone. The resulting bone mineral density measurements are used to establish or confirm a diagnosis of osteoporosis when the bone density is significantly lower than normal peak density. DXA is also used to monitor changes in bone density over time to evaluate the effects of treatment for osteoporosis or other conditions that affect bone mass. DXA scanners have a very low radiation dose compared to regular x-rays.
